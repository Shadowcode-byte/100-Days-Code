# ✨ 100 Days of Code Challenge – My Journey

This repository documents my participation in the **100 Days of Code** challenge, where I commit to coding every day (or as regularly as possible) to improve my skills, build projects, and track progress.

## 📅 Challenge Rules & Guidelines

- Code for at least **1 hour every day** (or as per schedule) for 100 days — or work on meaningful problems/projects consistently.  
- For each solved problem:  
  1. Copy the problem-statement (if applicable) as a comment at the top of the source file.  
  2. Write the solution below that comment.  
  3. Run and verify using sample / provided test cases.  
  4. Push the verified solution to this repository.  
- Maintain a log of daily progress — commit history serves as the record.  
- Reflect on learning: note down what you learnt, challenges faced, and improvements gained.  
- (Optional) Share progress on social / personal profile to stay motivated & accountable.
